### HaxMin JavaScript obfuscator

The GitHub project HaxMin by YAL‑Haxe is a Haxe‑based JavaScript minifier and lightweight obfuscator, tailored especially for code compiled from Haxe but also usable with plain JS.
It renames identifiers (while allowing whitelists for names used via Reflect), strips unnecessary formatting, and focuses on reducing file size while preserving functionality.
The tool runs via Neko, supports passing custom whitelist files or arrays, and is ideal for developers seeking concise, functional JS output without risking breakage in reflection-based code.
While HaxMin hasn't seen updates in a while, it's still useful today for Haxe users needing compact JS bundles, though larger ecosystems may prefer more actively maintained minifiers with broader optimizations.
