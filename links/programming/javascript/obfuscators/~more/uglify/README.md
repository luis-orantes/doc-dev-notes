### UglifyJS

UglifyJS is a comprehensive JavaScript toolkit—written in JavaScript—that provides a parser, code generator, compressor (optimizer), mangler, beautifier, scope analyzer, and AST‑processing APIs.
It transforms source code by removing whitespace and extraneous characters (minification), renaming identifiers to shorter forms (mangling), optimizing code flow (compression), and producing optional source maps to support debugging—a powerful tool for shrinking and obscuring JavaScript for production use.
