### Online Java Script Obfuscator

The JavaScript Obfuscator available at javascriptobfuscator.com is a tool—offered both as an online service and a desktop application—that transforms human-readable JavaScript into a heavily obfuscated, minified, and compressed format.
It aims to protect your code from reverse engineering, tampering, and unauthorized copying while preserving its functionality.
The desktop version adds advanced capabilities such as batch processing and locking features (e.g., restricting code execution by IP or domain), and it smoothly supports the latest ECMAScript standards.
