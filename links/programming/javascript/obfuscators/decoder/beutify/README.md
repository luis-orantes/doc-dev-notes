### Javascript Beautify

Beautifier.io is an online tool for prettifying and formatting code—including JavaScript, JSON, React.js, HTML, CSS, SCSS, and SASS—offering a variety of customization options such as indentation levels (tabs or spaces), line‑wrapping preferences, spacing rules, brace placement, and more.
It features a user‑friendly interface powered by CodeMirror, allowing code input and formatting directly in the browser, with options to copy, download, or clear the formatted output.
The project was created by Einar Lielmanis and is maintained by Liam Newman, and is open source under the MIT license, with CLI compatibility through a Python library and a Node.js package.
