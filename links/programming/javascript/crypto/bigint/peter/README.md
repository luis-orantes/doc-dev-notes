### BigInteger.js

BigInteger.js (by Peter Olson) is a JavaScript library that provides support for arbitrarily large integers, enabling arithmetic operations—like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modular arithmetic, exponentiation, bitwise operations, comparisons, primality testing, and more—on numbers of unlimited size beyond JavaScript's native Number limits.
It also supports method chaining, base conversions (including negative and custom bases), conversion to/from arrays, and even acts as a polyfill: if the JavaScript environment supports the native BigInt, the library simply wraps it to maintain compatibility.
