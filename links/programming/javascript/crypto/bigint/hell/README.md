### Big Number From Hell

This BigNumber class is a JavaScript library designed to perform mathematical operations with extremely high precision: for integer values, it supports virtually unlimited size without boundary constraints, and for floating-point numbers, it also provides very high precision—making it useful in contexts where standard JavaScript arithmetic can’t guarantee accuracy due to numeric limitations.
This class has no github repository.
