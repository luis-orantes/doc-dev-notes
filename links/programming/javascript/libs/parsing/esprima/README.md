### Javascript Parser

Esprima is a high-performance, standards-compliant JavaScript (ECMAScript) parser written in JavaScript itself, designed to generate Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for ES2019 (ECMA‑262 10th Edition) code and even offers experimental JSX support.
It provides both tokenization and full syntactic analysis, allowing developers to build tools for static code analysis, linting, transformation, minification, obfuscation, syntax validation, refactoring, autocomplete, and more, thanks to its rich feature set and extensive testing suite with roughly 1,600 unit tests.
Esprima runs in many environments, including modern browsers, Node.js, and Java-based engines like Rhino or Nashorn—making it a versatile foundation for leveraging AST-driven workflows in JavaScript tooling
