### App Store Connect Help

Learn about managing your App Store Connect account.

The page “App Store Connect Help” on Apple Developer provides comprehensive guidance for developers managing apps on Apple's App Store Connect platform.
It covers every aspect of the app lifecycle—from uploading builds (via Xcode, Transporter, or API), distributing beta versions using TestFlight, and submitting apps for review, to setting up in-app purchases, pricing, and availability.
The documentation also explains how to manage your team and roles, configure app metadata (like age ratings, privacy, and sandbox settings), handle Game Center features (leaderboards, achievements), monitor app performance and financial reports, and utilize App Store events. 
Additionally, it includes structured reference sections and instructions for troubleshooting, with links to role-specific notifications, sandbox testing, banking information, and security integrations
