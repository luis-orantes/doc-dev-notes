### Developer Content Policy

The Google Play Developer Content Policy outlines the standards and requirements that developers must adhere to when publishing apps on the Google Play Store.
These policies are designed to ensure user safety, data privacy, and a high-quality user experience.
Key areas covered include restrictions on content such as child endangerment, inappropriate material, and illegal activities; prohibitions against impersonation and intellectual property violations;
requirements for handling user data responsibly;
and guidelines for app functionality, monetization, and advertising.
Developers are also expected to provide accurate app listings, avoid deceptive behavior, and ensure their apps do not contain malware or unwanted software.
Compliance with these policies is essential for app approval and continued availability on the platform.
