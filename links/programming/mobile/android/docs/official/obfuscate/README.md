#### ProGuard

ProGuard is a tool used in Android development to optimize, obfuscate, and shrink Java and Kotlin code.
It helps reduce the size of the app by removing unused code and renaming classes, fields, and methods with short, meaningless names to make reverse engineering more difficult.
By doing this, ProGuard not only enhances security but also improves performance and decreases the overall size of the APK or AAB.
It's typically configured through a rules file where developers can specify what should or shouldn't be obfuscated or removed.
