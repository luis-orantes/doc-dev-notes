### Play integrity and signing services

Call the Integrity API at important moments in your app to check that user actions and requests are coming from your unmodified app binary, installed by Google Play, running on a genuine Android device. Your appâ€™s backend server can decide what to do next to prevent abuse, unauthorized access, and attacks.
