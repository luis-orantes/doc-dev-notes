### App Licensing

Android licensing, as outlined in the Google Play Licensing documentation, provides a service that enables developers to enforce licensing policies for applications distributed through Google Play.
This service allows an app to query Google Play at runtime to determine the licensing status of the current user, thereby permitting or restricting access accordingly.
Developers can implement flexible, app-specific licensing policies, including custom constraints such as temporary access for unlicensed users or device-specific restrictions.
The licensing mechanism relies on a secure key pair unique to each application, with the public key typically embedded in the app and the private key used by Google Play to sign license responses.
While the service is primarily intended for paid applications to verify legitimate purchases, it can also be utilized by free apps to manage access to APK expansion files.
To integrate licensing, developers must set up a Google Play publisher account, configure their development environment with the Licensing Verification Library (LVL), and implement appropriate license-checking logic within their apps.
It's important to note that the licensing service requires the Google Play client to be present on the user's device and is applicable only to apps distributed via Google Play
