### Cordova Purchase Plugin

The cc.fovea.cordova.purchase (also known as cordova-plugin-purchase) plugin offers a unified in‑app purchase (IAP) solution for Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic and even Capacitor apps across major platforms—iOS, Android, Windows (including UWP and Xbox), and macOS.
It supports consumables, non-consumables, auto-renewing subscriptions, receipt restoration and validation, plus features like introductory pricing and downloadable content.
Installation is as simple as adding the plugin via Cordova CLI or npm, and it exposes a consistent JavaScript API (store.*) across platforms.
The plugin is MIT‑licensed, actively maintained (latest stable version ~13.x), and compatible with Capacitor—though users should follow integration steps carefully for Angular/Ionic projects.
