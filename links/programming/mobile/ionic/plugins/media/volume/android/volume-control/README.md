### Phonegap-Android-VolumeControl

The Phonegap-Android-VolumeControl plugin by manusimpson is a Cordova/PhoneGap plugin designed to manage the music stream volume within Android applications.
It allows developers to programmatically set the device's music volume using JavaScript, facilitating the creation of custom volume controls like sliders or buttons within the app's interface.
Installation is straightforward via the Cordova CLI, and the plugin exposes a setVolume method that accepts a volume level (typically between 0 and 100) along with success and error callback functions.
This plugin is particularly useful for apps that require direct control over audio playback volume without relying on the device's physical buttons.
