### VolumeSlider

The VolumeSlider plugin by devgeeks is a Cordova/PhoneGap iOS plugin that integrates the native iOS MPVolumeView into hybrid apps, allowing developers to add a customizable volume slider directly within their application's interface.
This enables users to adjust the device's audio output without leaving the app. Installation is straightforward via the Cordova CLI, and the plugin provides JavaScript methods to create, show, and hide the slider with specified dimensions and positioning.
It's important to note that the MPVolumeView does not appear in the iOS Simulator; testing must be conducted on a physical device to observe the slider's functionality.
Licensed under the MIT License, this plugin offers a seamless way to incorporate native volume controls into iOS Cordova applications.
