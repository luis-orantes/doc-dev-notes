### Ionic Elastichat

The CodePen project “Ionic Elastichat” by Ross Martin demonstrates an Ionic v1 chat interface with a dynamically expanding (elastic) textarea, automatic link parsing, and timestamp formatting using AngularMoment and monospaced.elastic.
It features an ion-nav-view defining chat views, and the UI adjusts seamlessly as the user types multi-line messages—growing in height—while automatically hyperlinking URLs and displaying timestamps.
This lightweight example highlights how to integrate third-party AngularJS modules to build a polished, responsive chat experience in a hybrid mobile
