### CrossWalk - A web runtime built on Chrome

Changes the default view of Cordova by one based in Chromium.
This used to be used to have modern HTML5 for old Android OS.
It increased the size of the package by 10M and it had no support for iOS.
Actual Android OS already has modern HTML and therefore it is no longer needed.
