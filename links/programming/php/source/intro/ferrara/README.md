### PHP's Source Code For PHP Developers

In this introductory article, Anthony Ferrara begins a series designed to help PHP developers navigate and understand PHP’s internal C source code—even with no prior experience in C.
Focusing on PHP 5.4, the post guides readers on how to access the source (via SVN or tools like lxr.php.net for easy browsing), introduces the two main components—the Zend Engine (in the Zend folder, which powers parsing, runtime execution, and the language engine) and the core extensions (in the ext folder, where built-in functions and built-in classes like strpos, PDO, arrays, etc., reside).
Also covers fundamental C concepts and folder structure, with the goal of building comprehension rather than perfecting core contributions.
