### Configuring a WebDAV Server on Fedora 38

The article walks through how to set up a WebDAV server on Fedora 38 using Apache (httpd): 
installing Apache, enabling and starting the service;
creating a directory for WebDAV data with correct permissions;
configuring Apache (via a .conf file in /etc/httpd/conf.d) to enable WebDAV for that directory, enforce basic authentication with htpasswd, and restrict access to valid users;
securing the setup further by obtaining and installing an SSL/TLS certificate via Letâ€™s Encrypt; 
testing access using a WebDAV client like cadaver; and finally restarting Apache so all changes take effect.
