### The PECL “Packages” page on PECL (PHP Extension Community Library)

The PECL is a browsable directory of all official PHP extensions available for installation.
It categorizes each extension (e.g., Caching, Encryption, Database, Networking), lists their names, and displays the total count of packages available.
Users can click through to find information about each extension, browse by functionality, track recent releases, search among packages, and access download statistics or documentation.
