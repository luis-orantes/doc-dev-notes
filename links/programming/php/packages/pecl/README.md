### The PECL “Packages” page on PECL (PHP Extension Community Library)

The PECL is a browsable directory of all official PHP extensions available for installation.
It categorizes each extension (e.g., Caching, Encryption, Database, Networking), lists their names, and displays the total count of packages available.
Users can click through to find information about each extension, browse by functionality, track recent releases, search among packages, and access download statistics or documentation.

PECL (PHP Extension Community Library) is still used today, but its role has evolved and it's no longer the go‑to tool for every PHP dependency need.
Composer has largely taken over for managing pure PHP packages (libraries, modules, etc.) via Packagist, because it offers much better dependency resolution, project‑level installs, and modern workflows. 

However, PECL remains relevant for installing PHP extensions written in C—those that need to be compiled and loaded into PHP (like Xdebug, Redis, imagick, etc.).
Many of these are still distributed via PECL and used in production environments. 

That said, there’s a newer tool called PIE (PHP Installer for Extensions) that is being positioned as the future replacement for PECL, offering a more Composer‑like experience with better integration into modern workflows.
PECL isn’t deprecated yet, but PIE is gaining traction and is intended to eventually replace it.
