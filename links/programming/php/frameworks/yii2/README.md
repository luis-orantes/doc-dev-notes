### Use Lavarel Instead of Yii2

Yii is still in use and maintained (particularly Yii 2), though it’s no longer the bleeding‑edge “new” framework and is less hyped than alternatives like Laravel or Symfony.
The official “Release Statuses” page shows that Yii 2 is actively tracked and receiving updates. 
The project is also working toward Yii 3, which is under development (95% of its packages released as of the progress report).

But for new projects, many developers choose more actively growing ecosystems unless there’s a good reason to use Yii (e.g. familiarity, existing codebase, specific extension support).
