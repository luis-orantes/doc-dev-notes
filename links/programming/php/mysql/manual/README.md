### MySQL Improved Extension

The mysqli extension (MySQL Improved) is PHP’s modern interface for interacting with MySQL (or MySQL‑compatible) databases.
It offers both object‑oriented and procedural APIs, and supports advanced features like prepared statements, transactions, multiple statements, metadata access, and improved debugging.
It also provides functions for connecting, querying, escaping input, managing result sets, and handling connection details such as error reporting and character sets.
